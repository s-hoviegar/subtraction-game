# Subtraction Game

The Subtraction Game (One-Heap Game of Nim) is a mathematical
turn-based strategy game that involves removing objects from a set.
The objective of the game is to be the player who doesn't take the
last object. Players take turns removing objects, but they must remove
at least one object and at max the number defined in "New Game" page
with "Moves" field. The player who takes the last object, loses the game.
So be carefull choosing the objects and make your opponent take the
last one! Be aware that you cannot beat the computer if the first turn
is set to "Computer".
